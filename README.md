# Phonetic Clarity & Surprisal
## Overview

This is a small python project to testify the relation between speech information and articulatory clarity. It is said that people tend to articulate more clearly when there is more information included in the speech.  
In this project, you will find two parameters—duration and surprisal—both calculated as the average values at the word level. Duration represents the clarity of articulation for a word—the longer the duration, the clearer the word has been pronounced. On the other hand, surprisal quantifies the unexpectedness of a word in its context. A word with higher surprisal is less predictable and likely carries more informational content.  
For duration data, I began by recording my own voice while reading 10 English sentences aloud. Using the Munich Automatic Segmentation System (MAUS), I segmented the audio into phonetic units and extracted the duration of each phoneme. These durations were then aggregated to calculate the average duration for each word in the sentences, providing a measure of articulatory clarity at the word level.  
For surprisal data, I focused on quantifying the unexpectedness of each word in the context of natural language. Surprisal is defined mathematically as $$I(P_i) = -\log(P_i)$$, where $$P_i$$ is the probability of the word occurring. To calculate these probabilities, I trained a unigram and bigram language model using the "wiki.train.raw" dataset. The unigram model provides the probability of individual words, while the bigram model incorporates contextual information by considering word pairs. Using these models, I calculated the surprisal values for each word, reflecting the amount of information or unexpectedness it conveys.
